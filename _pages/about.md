I am a postdoctoral researcher in mathematics at the University of North Texas, working with [Pieter Allaart](https://sites.math.unt.edu/~allaart/). 
I completed my PhD in mathematics at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in 2024, under the supervision of [KÃ¡roly Simon](https://math.bme.hu/~simonk/).

My field of research is Fractal Geometry. A set is called a fractal if it has a complex, detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales. These intricate sets often arise in nature as the invariant set of a chaotic dynamical system or the attractor of an iterated function system. In my research, I mostly focus on the dimension theory of fractal sets and measures.
